			The ticket lottery opens Monday, September 22nd at 10am and closes Friday, September 26th at 4pm. You can enter the lottery any time during this window. Entering early does not increase your chances of being selected. You will receive an email after the lottery closes informing you if you received a seat. To claim your wristband, you must go to the IM Field between 12pm-6pm on Monday, September 29th with your BruinCard. Staff will scan your BruinCard and wristband you. The Bruin Bash Festival will be held on the IM Field, starting at 5pm. The concert will be held at LA Tennis Center, and the two films will be screened in Ackerman Grand Ballroom and the Carnesale Commons Palisades Room. All 3 events begin at 8pm. Further information can be found on the full desktop site.</div>
