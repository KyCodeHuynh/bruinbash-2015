    <h3>Where is the concert being held?</h3>
   <p>WE’RE BACK IN PAULEY PAVILION (flood 2k14 never forget).  See the map <a href="http://www.ucla.edu/pdf/ucla-campus-map.pdf">here</a>.
    The venue is on campus, on Bruin Walk (Between De Neve Residence Halls and Bruin Plaza),
    across from the Intramural Fields.</p>

    <h3>How does wristbanding work?</h3>
    <p>You must bring your BruinCard to the IM Field on Monday, September 21th between 2:00pm-6:00pm.
        We will scan your BruinCard to confirm you are a currently registered UCLA undergraduate, and
        then we will wristband you.  Wristbands will be distributed on a first-come, first-served basis.
        One ticket per student and per BruinCard, no exceptions.</p>

    <h3>How does seating work?</h3>
    <p>Once your BruinCard is scanned, you will have the option of choosing which level you would like to sit in.
    Seating will be first come, first served.  There will three sections of seating: Floor, Level 1, and Level 2.
    Once a level seating is full, you will have the option of choosing between the two levels of seating that remain.
    When two levels of seating are full, you will be assigned a wristband to the level remaining.  Wristbands will
    be color coded by level.</p>

    <h3>How can I sit with my friends?</h3>
    <p>Absolutely. In order to sit with your friends, it is mandatory that you go to
        the IM Field with the group you wish to sit with at the concert. After your
        BruinCards are scanned, ask for the same level of seating.
    </p>

    <h3>Can I pick up a wristband for my friend?</h3>
    <p>
        No, students may not use multiple BruinCards to pick up wristbands for fellow
        students. One wristband per BruinCard per student. There will be no switching
        of wristbands. Wristbands will be placed directly on the wrist of all students,
        no exceptions.
    </p>

    <h3>What happens after I get a wristband?</h3>
    <p>Congratulations! You are one step closer to the best night of your life.  Upon receiving a wristband,
        you should stick around and check out sponsors on the <a href="#festival-page">field</a>, who will be giving out free prizes.
        The lines to enter Pauley will be on the IM field and open at 5:00pm. At 6:00pm we will open the doors to Pauley,
        and allow those lines to enter.
        There will be no in-and-outs to the concert,
        so once you are inside, if you leave Pauley you will not be allowed re-entry. There
        are concessions being sold, and restrooms will be open inside the venue.

    </p>

    <h3>What can I bring into the concert?</h3>
    <p>You are required to bring your BruinCard to the concert.  You may bring money
    to purchase concessions, which will be sold beginning at 6:00pm inside the venue.
    You may NOT bring any bags or bottles/ liquids into the venue.</p>


    <h3>When do doors open? When does the show begin?</h3>
    <p>Doors open at 6pm. Show begins at 8pm.</p>

    <h3>When will you stop allowing entrance into Pauley Pavilion?</h3>
    <p>You must be in line to enter Pauley no later than 9:00pm.  After 9:00pm, your wristband will become
        invalid for entry into the concert.</p>

    <h3>May non-UCLA students attend this event?</h3>
    <p>Unfortunately not, this event is reserved for UCLA students only.</p>

    <h3>Why can’t you just book Kanye?</h3>
    <p>Too busy working on his presidential run.</p>

    <h3>And most importantly: Will there be food?</h3>
    <p>Of course. Concessions will be sold in Pauley starting at 6:00pm.  They will
    be sold on the north and south side of the upper concourse.</p>
