        <h3>How do I get in?</h3>
        <p>One “ticket” will be placed on every student’s BruinCard.
            In order to receive a wristband for the concert, come to
            the IM during the allotted time frame of 2:00pm- 6:00pm with
            your BruinCard.  Your card will be scanned, and you will then
            have the opportunity to pick up a wristband on the IM field. No
            wristbands will be given if the student of a presented BruinCard
            is not physically present.  Once you receive your wristband, go
            check out the sponsors on the field and score some sick giveaways!
            Line- up to enter Pauley will open at 5:00pm on the IM Field, and
            the doors will open at 6:00pm. No bags/purses/fanny packs/bottles/
            etc. are permitted on the IM Field.  All you will need is BruinCard
            and (optional) money for concessions, which will be sold in Pauley.

        <h3>Can my friend use my BruinCard to pick up a wristband?</h3>
        <p>No, you must be present with your own BruinCard to get a wristband</p>

        <h3>What are the wristbands used for?</h3>
        <p>Wristbands picked up at the IM Field will be used for entrance
            to the concert.  A separate wristbanding system will be used for
            the film (see below), and the Festival does not require a wristband
            for entry. In ALL cases, however, you will need to have a valid BruinCard
            to partake in these three events.
        </p>

        <h3>Will there be campouts this year?</h3>
        <p>There will be absolutely NO campouts this year. Any attempts at forming
            a lineup before set entry time to the IM Field (2:00pm-6:00pm) are prohibited
            and will result in immediate disbursement of the line by on-duty security.
            All students who are interested in attending the concert will be able to
            receive a wristband, and will be able to sit with their group of friends.
            Therefore, there can be no attempts at lining up for a wristband until 2:00pm.
