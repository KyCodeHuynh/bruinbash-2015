        <h3>How do I get in?</h3>
        <p>One “ticket” will be placed on every student’s BruinCard.
            In order to receive a wristband for the concert, come to
            the IM during the allotted time frame of 2:00pm to 6:00pm with your BruinCard.
            Your card will be scanned, and you will then have the opportunity to
            pick up a wristband on the IM field.  Once you receive your wristband,
            go check out the sponsors on the field and score some sick giveaways!
            Line- up to enter Pauley will open at 5:00pm on the IM Field, and the
            doors will open at 6:00pm.  All you will need is BruinCard and (optional)
            money for concessions, which will be sold in Pauley.

        <h3>Can my friend use my BruinCard to pick up a wristband?</h3>
        <p>No, you must be present with your own BruinCard to get a wristband</p>

        <h3>What are the wristbands used for?</h3>
        <p>Concert, not film or festival (film is first come-first served, festival is open to all!)</p>

        <h3>Will there be campouts this year?</h3>
        <p>NAHH, there will be absolutely NO campouts this year.  There will be a morning
            activity for first-year students on Monday.  This system gives students who
            attend that program on Monday an equal opportunity during wristband distribution.
            Additionally, this system is fairer to commuting students, transfer students,
            non-traditional students, and students who prefer to be sleeping instead of standing in line at 5am.
